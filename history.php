      <p>In 2010, it was renamed as Peace and Human Security Institute (PHSI),
        becoming the peace-building arm of the Office of the University President.
        Today, under Dr. Ma. Carla A. Ochotorena, the office takes the lead
        in engaging WMSU in the government-led peace efforts to be the main
        protagonist in peace education and research on the resolution of local conflicts.</p>
